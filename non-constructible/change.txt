Objective: Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your possession, write a function that returns
the minimum amount of change (the minimum sum of money) that you cannot create. The given coins have any positive integer value 
and aren't necessarily unique (i.e. you can have multiple coins of the same value).
Sample Input:
coins = [5,7,1,1,2,3,22]
Sample Output:

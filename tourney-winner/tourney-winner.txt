Objective: There is an algorithms tournament in 
which teams compete in a round robin, where each 
team faces off against all other teams.
Teams compete two at a time, with one home team 
and one away team. There is always one winner and 
one loser; there are no ties. A team receives 
three points if it wins and 0 points if it loses.
The winner receives the most points total.

Given an array of pairs representing the teams that
competed against each other and an array containing
the results of each competition, create a function 
that returns the winner of the tournament. 

Sample Input:
competitions = [
    ["HTML],"C#"],
    ["C#", "Python"],
    ["Python","HTML"],
]
results = [0,0,1]

Sample output:
"Python"
C# beats HTML, Python beats C#, Python beats HTML
HTML - 0 points
C# - 3 points
Python - 6 points

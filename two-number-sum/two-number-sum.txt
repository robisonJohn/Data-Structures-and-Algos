Objective: write a function that takes in a non-empty array
of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum.
If two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the 
function should return them in an array, in any order. Else, return 
an empty array.
Note that the sum must be the sum of two distinct integers.
Example:
array = [3,5,-4,8,11,1,-1,6]
targetSum = 10
returns [11,-1]

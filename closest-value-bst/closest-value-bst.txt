Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree and a target integer value and returns the closest value to the target value 
contained in the BST.
Assume that there will only be one closest value. 
Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if 
it satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or 
equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None / null.
